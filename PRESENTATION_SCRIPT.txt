PRESENTATION SCRIPT
==================

[Introduction]
"Hello professor, today I'll be presenting my PWA application. My application is called Smart Notes, and it allows users to take notes with photos and location information."

[Main Features]
"While developing my project, I made sure to meet all the requirements:

1. First, I developed my application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I didn't use any additional frameworks.

2. I implemented two important native device features:
   - Camera API for taking photos
   - Geolocation API for adding location to notes

Let me demonstrate these features..."

[Demo - Adding Notes]
"We're now on the main screen of the application. I'll click the 'Add Note' button to create a new note.
- I'm entering a title and content
- Now I'll click the 'Take Photo' button to capture a photo
- As you can see, location information is automatically added
- I'm saving the note, and you can see it displayed on the main screen"

[Demo - Offline Functionality]
"Now I'd like to demonstrate the offline capability of the application.
- I'm turning off my internet connection
- As you can see, the application is still working
- I can add new notes
- And access my existing notes"

[Demo - PWA Features]
"Since our application is a PWA:
- It can be installed directly from the browser
- Works offline
- Loads quickly
- And has a responsive design"

[Technical Details]
"From a technical perspective:
- I used Service Workers for offline functionality
- Cache API for file caching
- Local Storage for storing notes
- Manifest file for defining PWA features"

[Closing]
"Finally, you can access my project's source code on GitHub:
https://github.com/AhmetArtunBostan/Project

And the live demo is available at:
https://ahmetartunbostan.github.io/Project/

I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have."

[Answers to Potential Questions]

Q: "Why did you choose these native features?"
A: "I chose camera and location services because they enhance the note-taking experience. Users can make their notes more detailed with both visual and location information."

Q: "How does the Service Worker operate?"
A: "The Service Worker acts as a proxy between the browser and the server. It caches files and serves them from this cache when we're offline."

Q: "How did you optimize the application's performance?"
A: "I optimized performance through minimal JavaScript usage, optimized images, and an efficient caching strategy."

Q: "What features are you planning to add in the future?"
A: "In the future, I plan to add features like push notifications, note sharing, and cloud synchronization."

[Tips for Presentation]
- Stay calm and confident
- Check everything works before the demo
- Pronounce technical terms correctly
- Give the professor opportunities to ask questions
- Keep eye contact
- Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
